I inititally entered this competition with an entirely different prototype (it was rushed and terrible). But I took the opportunity to iterate and redesign and I am pretty pleased with the outcome, although there some additional tweaks and changes I plan on making, as time allows (I am working on other side projects).

Some concepts implemented: responsive, performance optimizations, styling, and DRY.

I augmented some of the metrics by identifying additional data sources
